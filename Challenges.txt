One of the biggest challenges I faced in performing this lab was correctly converting each letter of the key and message into binary using ASCII values, especially making sure that the binary digits were 8 bits long. It was slightly tricky to also perform the XOR operation on every bit and recall resulting values. Another challenge was visualizing the encryption and decryption process well enough to draw a proper flowchart. I used online converters and double-checked each step to avoid making mistakes.
